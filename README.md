# :octocat: B'S TIC TAC TOE: A Description :octocat:

This application allows the user to be able to complete a list of authenticating
actions including signing up, signing, in, changing their password, and signing
out. As well, the authenticated user can then play a game of tic tac toe against
themselves or by alternating turns with someone that has joined them at the
computer. The idea for this app was presented to me from General Assembly as
Project 1. It was my job to build out the app and make sure it included certain
functionality to successfully pass, but futhermore, to make my very first
addition to my portfolio of completed works.

## Planning Story

Ok, I can not stress enough that I did not spend as much time planning as I
should have because I spent many hours looking at my problems all bundled
together and without being able to disect them and slowly work to accomplish one
goal after another and end up with a working game, I felt very stuck many
times. I did however, follow the suggested schedule to the best of my ability,
which was a lifesaver. As I followed the schedule and went down the checklist I
planned to treat each checkpoint as a feature that I would create on a
seperate branch, merge to master on success, and then push. This method started
off very well for me and the only thing was when I got to the part of the game
logic and I was trying this, that, deleting, and restarting, it was harder
for me to maintain the original flow I created, which I would absolutely try
to keep in tack as I move on to other and more complex projects. Another huge
asset, my classmates, helped me to see that I was trying to solve the whole
game's logic in it's entirety, rather than come up with small attainable goals
to further me along. For sure, this experience was a learning one.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to sign up, so that I can have an account to log into.
- As a user, I want to sign out, so that I can keep my account secure.
- As a user, I want the ability to change my password, so that I have more
security.
- As a user, I want to create a new game, so that I can play a new tic tac toe
game.
- As a user, I want to be able to rotate between x and o, so that I can play the
game vs. myself.
- As a user, I want to be alerted when I have won/loss, so that I will know when
the game is over.

### Technologies Used

- General Assembly API
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to have my gameboard not move as the game is played.
- Would like to eventually update the styling, from the overall look of the app,
to the forms, to the game board and pieces. I would also like to allow for users
to view unfinished games, but instead of seeing a number of games played, see a
virtual representation of their board that they can then click on to reinitiate
and then finish that game.
